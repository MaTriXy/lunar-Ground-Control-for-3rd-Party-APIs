# Commented out due to flakyness.
# Pending fix: https://lunar-shots.atlassian.net/browse/MK-646

# Feature: Graceful Shutdown
#     Scenario Outline: Shutdown while there is a request in transit
#         Given Lunar Proxy is up
#         And   API Provider is up
#         When    Request is made through Lunar Proxy to a high-latency provider
#         And     Lunar Proxy is stopped gracefully with <signal> before response is obtained
#         And     Another request is made after graceful shutdown started
#         Then    The response for the request pre-shutdown is 200
#         And     The response for request post-shutdown is 503
#         And     Lunar Proxy is down
        
#         Examples:
#             | signal   |
#             | SIGINT   |
#             | SIGTERM  |
